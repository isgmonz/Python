# According to PEP 8, Python variable names should be written in snake_case. Additionally, they must meet the following characteristics:

# They must be in lowercase and separate words using underscores '_'.
# Constants are written in uppercase and SNAKE_CASE.
# They must start with a letter or underscore.
# The use of keywords as names is prohibited.
# The names should be descriptive.
